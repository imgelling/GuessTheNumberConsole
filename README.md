# GuessTheNumberConsole
  
# About
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the classic number guessing game.  Given a range, 1 - 10 (inclusive) for example, a random number is chosen in the range of the numbers.  The user
needs to guess what number is chosen.  If incorrect, the user is told wether the random number is less or greater than the number guessed.  If correct, a "You win"
message is shown and user is taken back to the main menu.  The number of guesses is tracked for a "score."  

# Other
&emsp;\- This contains a solution for MSVS2022.  If you are using something else, just download the main.cpp.
&emsp;\- This was created for my YouTube channel for a easy game series.  It is NOT intended to be the best and best way to do any of this.  It is for entertainment purposes only  
&emsp;	\- This was written in MSVS 2022.  It may compile on other platforms with other compilers.  I have not tested it but as simple as this is, it should work with any C++ compiler and platform with a console window.  
&emsp;	\- I took some time to make sure all input is validated for what the program is expecting.  Probably didn't think of everything.
