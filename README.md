# About
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the classic number guessing game.  Given a range, 1 - 10 (inclusive) for example, a random number is chosen in the range of the numbers.  The user
needs to guess what number is chosen.  If incorrect, the user is told wether the random number is less or greater than the number guessed.  If correct, a "You win"
message is shown and user is taken back to the main menu.  The number of guesses is tracked for a "score."
